May 4, 11:50PM: did a mind map of the functions and how the code would look like, and discussed it with my teammates. Decided to write the code in C++, and with functions for each instructions.
May 7, 8:30PM: corrected the code started by my teammmate, rewrote all the opcodes and halting options, rewrote some of the code inside each instruction and added the constant zero register.
May 8, 12:00AM: finished correcting all the opcodes, troubleshooted some more issues with the code
May 8, 10:00PM: choose the bonuses for the project, our code is for an input file written in binary machine code, brainstormed with my teammates for continuing further the code
May 9, 9:00PM: we had a zoom meeting, and decided to rewrite the code because our basics were wrong, written for an machine code input file
May 9, 10:30PM: created the new file, wrote the NUM_REG, instruction struct, register vector, memory map, pc, split string function, split string 2 function for the instruction, and rewrote all the switch case for the execute function, also rewrote the main in a more eligible clearer way
May 10, 2:00AM: rewrote all the execute function with the correct execution for each instruction
May 10, 9:00PM: wrote some more lines, for the if cases with each execution, for each fomart R, I SB, and UJ, wrote the testcases
May 11, 2:00PM: wrote instructions for the load and store, (lb, lh, lw, lbu...) and wrote the report.
